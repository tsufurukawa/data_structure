Odin Project: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms

Project 1: Searching Binary Trees
- Building a simple binary tree data structure from some arbitrary input and also the "crawler" function that will locate data inside of it.

Project 2: Knight's Travails
- Building a function "knight_moves" that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
